# Features

In addition to the features that are auto-tested, the graphical user interface
of our project implements the following features:

*(Remove those that are unimplemented)*

 - A simple placement viewer (Task 5)
 - A basic playable game (Task 10)
 - Playable against a computer opponent (Task 15)
 - Running score counter
 - Instruction bar
 - Playable with up-to four players
 - Roll counter
 - Winner display

List additional noteworthy features beyond those in the assignment
specification that you have added, if any.

## Player instructions

Use this section of the file to write any necessary instructions on
how to play your implementation of the game. You can assume the player
knows the game rules; the purpose of this section is to document how
to use any parts of your game GUI that are not intuitively obvious
(and not documented in the GUI itself).

This section is optional.

Notes:

To select the die you want to keep on the second roll, click them. They will glow red if selected. To unselect
click again.

When you have completed your turn, click end turn.
