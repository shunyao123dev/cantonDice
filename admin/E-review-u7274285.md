### Comments 

<The best thing about this code is that the logic is clear, 
the variable names are set in a way that makes it easy to 
understand what he is doing, he uses helper functions in 
this task and calls functions from previous tasks, and he 
writes java code that has good readability and is maintainable. 
Overall he did a great job!>
